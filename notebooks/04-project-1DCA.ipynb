        "# Project: 1D elementary cellular automata\n### Michiel Stock, Bram De Jaegher, Daan Van Hauwermeiren\n### 18 December 2019\nIn this exercise, we simulate elementary one-dimensional cellular automata (CA). It is a simple application, which nevertheless illustrates many of the Julia programming concepts as it has all aspects of an individual-based model.\n\n# What are elementary cellular automata?\n\nCellular automata are simple dynamical models, discrete in time, space, and state. In elementary cellular automata, the states only take the values 0 or 1. The state of the cell at time $t+1$ is solely determined by the state of that cell at time $t$ and the states of its neighbors. Since these three cells can jointly only take eight unique values, i.e.,"

        "This means that if we assign one state to each combination, we have $2^8=256$ unique elementary cellular automata. Naturally, many of them are equivalent up to some symmetry, but there is quite some diversity in behavior among these different classes.\n\nAn integer between 0 and 255 solely defines every elementary cellular automaton. The binary representation of this number determines the state updates. This is best explained by showing some examples.\n\n![Some example of the elementary CA rules. Every integer between 0 and 255 (in binary) represents a rule.](../figures/CArules.png)\n\nSo starting from an initial state vector, we can represent the evolution of the states by a space-time diagram.\n\n![Example of the rules applied consequently with an initial state of only one active cell.](../figures/CAexamples.png)\n\nIn implementing an elementary CA, we use cyclic boundary conditions. Here, we wrap the state vector around a circle: the right neighbor of the last cell is again the first cell (and *vice versa*).\n\n# A basic implementation\n\n## Update rule\n\nWe start by implementing the updating rule from a single state to the next. This can be implemented in a variety of ways, but let us provide one that is reasonably concise and efficient. It will also nicely illustrate some aspects of Julia's type system.\n\nUpdating a cell depends only on the state of the cell and its two neighbors. Let us use three Boolean variables `(l, s, r)` to denote them. Here `s` is the state of the cell of interest, and `l` and `r` are the states of its left and right neighbor, respectively. An integer between 0 and 255 can represent the rule, hence an 8-bit number. The rule for updating a state is implemented below."
