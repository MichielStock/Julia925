# Basic computing
Let's get started with the basics. Some mathematical operations,

```julia; term=true
1 + 2       # adding integers
```

```julia; term=true
1.0 + 2.0   # adding floats
```

```julia; term=true
2 / 4       # standard division
```

```julia; term=true
div(2, 4)   # Computes 2/4 truncated to an integer
2 ÷ 4
```

```julia; term=true
7 % 3       # get the remainder of the integer division
```

```julia; term=true
35 \ 7      # inverse division
```

```julia; term=true
1 // 3      # fractions
```

```julia; term=true
1//2 + 1//4
```

```julia; term=true
'c'        # characters (unicode)
```

```julia; term=true
:symbol    # symbols, mostly used for macros
```

variable assignment,

```julia; term=true
x = 2
```

```julia; term=true
τ = 1 / 37  # unicode variable names are allowed
```

unicode! In most Julia editing environments, unicode math symbols can be typed when starting with a "\ and hitting [TAB].

```julia
# type \alpha  and <TAB>

```

Operators are overrated.

```julia
5x         # This works
```

But strings are quite essential,

```julia
mystery = "life, the universe and everything"
```

and string interpolation is performed with `$`.


```julia
println("The answer to $mystery is $(3*2*7)")
```

repetitions of strings can be done using the operators `*` and `^`.
This use of `*` and `^` makes sense by analogy with multiplication and exponentiation. Just as `4^3` is equivalent to `4*4*4`, we expect `"Spam"^3` to be the same as `"Spam"*"Spam"*"Spam"`, and it is.

```julia
breakfast = "eggs"
abetterbreakfast = "SPAM"
println(breakfast * abetterbreakfast)
println(breakfast * abetterbreakfast^3 * breakfast)
```

Lots of handy ´String`-operations are available in the standard library of Julia:

```julia
uppercase("This feels like shouting.")
```

```julia
findfirst("a", "banana")
```

```julia
findfirst("na", "banana")
```

```julia
findnext("na", "banana", 4)
```

Unlike `Strings´, a `Char` value represents a single character and is surrounded by single quotes.

```julia
'x'
```

The operator `∈` (\in TAB) is a boolean operator that takes a character and a string and returns true if the first appears in the second:

```julia
'a' ∈ "banana"
```

> **Question**: Check the behaviour of the relational operators on strings.

```julia; eval=false
"apples" == "pears"
```

```julia; eval=false
"apples" < "pears"
```

```julia; eval=false
"apples" < "Pears"
```

All binary arithmetic and bitwise operators have an updating version that assigns the result of the operation back into the left operand. The updating version of the binary operator is formed by placing a, `=`, immediately after the operator.

```julia; term=true
x += 2  # inplace update of x
x += 2  # inplace update of x
```

Similarly to Matlab, when using the REPL, Julia will print the result of every statement by default. To suppress this behavious, just end the statement with a semicolon.

```julia; term=true
a = 10;  # not printed
```

```julia; term=true
a = 20
```

# Boolean operators
From zero to one.

```julia; term = true
# Boolean operators
!true
```

```julia; term=true
!false
```

```julia; term=true
1 == 1
```

```julia; term=true
2 == 1
```

```julia; term=true
1 != 1
```

```julia; term=true
2 != 1
```

```julia; term=true
1 < 10
```

```julia; term=true
1 > 10
```

```julia; term=true
2 <= 2
```

```julia; term=true
2 >= 2
```

```julia; term=true
# Comparisons can be chained
1 < 2 < 3
```

```julia; term=true
2 < 3 < 2
```

```julia; term=true
# Logical operators
true && true
true || false
```

Likewise, we have the Boolean logic operators `&&` (AND), `||` (OR) and `⊻` (XOR, exclusive or).
```julia; term=true
true && true
```

```julia; term=true
true && false
```

```julia; term=true
true || false
```

```julia; term=true
false || false
```

```julia; term=true
true ⊻ false
```

```julia; term=true
true ⊻ true
```

> **Question**: predict the outcomes of the following statements.

```julia; eval=false
x, y = true, false

(x || y) && !(y || y)
```

```julia; term=true
(x ⊻ y) && (!x ⊻ !y)
```

```julia; term=true
(x || y) ⊻ (x && y)
```

# Control flow
The `if`, `else`, `elseif`-statement is instrumental to any programming language,

```julia
if 4 > 3
  println("A")
elseif 3 > 4
  println("B")
else
  println("C")
end
```

Julia allows for some very condense control flow structures.
```julia
y = condition ? valueiftrue : valueiffalse
```

> **Assignment** Complete the clip function: $\min(0, \max(1, x))$ for a given $x$, without making use of the functions `min` and `max`.

```julia; eval=false
x = 2.0

clip(x) = ...
```

# Looping

```julia
characters = ["Harry", "Ron", "Hermione"]

for char in characters
  println("Character $char")
end

for (i, char) in enumerate(characters)
  println("$i. $char")
end

pets = ["Hedwig", "Pig", "Crookhanks"]

for (char, pet) in zip(characters, pets)
  println("$char has $pet as a pet")
end
```

Strings can also be looped

```julia
getme = "a shrubbery"

for letter ∈ getme
  println("$letter")
end
```

```julia;eval = false
n = 1675767616;

while n > 1
  println(n)
  if n % 2 == 0
    global n = div(n, 2)
  else
    global n = 3n + 1
  end
end
```

(Note: [they got closer to cracking this one](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-terence-tao-and-the-collatz-conjecture-20191211/?mc_cid=a3adbffb9f&mc_eid=41ed2fca13).)

# Functions
Julia puts the fun in functions. User-defined functions can be declared as follows,

```julia
function square(x)
  result = x * x
  return result
end
```

```julia; term=true
square(2)
```

```julia; term=true
square(2.0)
```

```julia; term=true
square("ni")   # the multiplication of strings is defined as a concatenation
```

A more condensed version of of `square(x)`.

```julia
s(x) = x * x
```

Passing an array to a function that takes a single element as argument takes a special syntax. By putting a `.` before the brackets, the function is executed on all the elements of the Array. More on this in **Part2: collections**.
```julia; eval = false
s([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])   # Multiplication is not defined for Arrays
```

```julia
s.([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # This is an elements-wise execution of s()
```

Keyword arguments are defined using a semicolon in the back signature and a default value can be assigned. "Keywords" assigned before the semicolon are default values but their keywords are not ignored.

```julia
safelog(x, offset=0.1; base=10) = log(x + offset) / log(base)
```

```julia; term=true
safelog(0)
```

```julia; term=true
safelog(0, 0.01)
```

```julia; term=true
safelog(0, 0.01, base=2)
```

When functions have a variable number of arguments, one can use the *slurping* `...` operator to denote a variable number of arguments. The argument will be treated as a collection. For example

```julia; term=true
function mymean(X...)
  m = zero(first(X))  # ensures to be the same type as x
  # m = 0.0  # alternative that is less tidy
  for x in X
    m += x
  end
  return m / length(X)
end

mymean(1, 3, 5)
```

```julia; term=true
mymean(1, 3, 5, 7)
```

Similarly, the *splatting* operator can be used to split a collection into its individual elements.

```julia
c = [1.0, 3.0, 5.0];

mymean(c...)
```

When unsure of what a function does, the documentation can be viewed by adding a "?" in front of the function.

```julia
# type ?sort and hit <ENTER>
```

For a lot of standard Julia functions a in-place version is defined. In-place means that the function changes one of the input arguments of the function. As an example, `sort()` sorts and returns the array passed as argument, it does not change the original array. In contrast, `sort!()` is the inplace version of sort and directly sorts the array passed as argument.

```julia
my_unsorted_list = [4, 5, 9, 7, 1, 9]

sort(my_unsorted_list)
```

```julia; term=true
my_unsorted_list
```

```julia; term=true
sort!(my_unsorted_list)

my_unsorted_list
```

Specific functions can be generated if you have more information on the input type.
This is called multiple dispatch.

The `::` operator attaches type annotations to expressions and variables.

How does the documentation for the function square look like after you executed the cell below?

```julia
function square(x::Float64)
  println("using function with floats")
  result = x * x
  return result
end

println(square(4))
println(square(4.))
```

More about types in the next section !

# Macros
Macros provide a method to include generated code in the final body of a program. It is a way of generating a new output expression, given an unevaluated input expression. When your Julia program runs, it first parses and evaluates the macro, and the processed code produced by the macro is eventually evaluated like an ordinary expression.

Some nifty basic macros are `@time` and `@show`. `@time` prints the cpu time and memory allocations of an expression.

```julia
@time square(10)
```

The `@show` macro is often useful for debugging purposes. It displays both the expression to be evaluated and its result, finally returning the value of the result.

```julia
@show 1 + 1
```

# Plotting
Quite essential for scientific programming is the visualisation of the results. `Plots` is the Julia package that handles a lot of the visualisation. `rand(10)`, returns an array of 10 random floats between 0 and 1.

```julia
using Plots

plot(1:10, rand(10), label="first")
plot!(1:10, rand(10), label="second") # adding to current figure using plot!

scatter!([1:10], randn(10), label="scatter")

xlabel!("x")
ylabel!("f(x)")
title!("My pretty Julia plot")
```

```julia
# notice the use of a symbol as an argument !
plot(0:0.1:10, x -> sin(x) / x, xlabel="x", ylabel="sin(x)/x", color=:red, marker=:square, legend=:none)
```

```julia
contour(-5:0.1:5, -10:0.1:10, (x, y) -> 3x^2-4y^2 + x*y/6)
```

# Exercises

## 1

Write a function named `rightjustify` that takes a string named `s` as a parameter and prints the string with enough leading spaces so that the last letter of the string is in column 70 of the display.

Use string concatenation and repetition. Also, Julia provides a built-in function called `length`. Check what it does!

```julia;eval = false
function rightjustify()
end
```

## 2

1. Write a function `printgrid` that draws a grid like the following:

```julia;eval = false
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
|         |         |
+ - - - - + - - - - +
```

2. Write a function that draws a similar grid with four rows and four columns.

Tips:

To print more than one value on a line, you can print a comma-separated sequence of values:

`println("+", "-")`

The function `print` does not advance to the next line.

```julia;eval = false
function printgrid()
end
```

## 3

The function `time` returns the current Greenwich Mean Time in seconds since "the epoch", which is an arbitrary time used as a reference point. On UNIX systems, the epoch is 1 January 1970.
Write a script that reads the current time and converts it to a time of day in hours, minutes, and seconds, plus the number of days since the epoch.

```julia;eval = false
```

## 4

Fermat’s Last Theorem says that there are no positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that

$a^n + b^n = c^n$

for any value of $n$ greater than 2.

1. Write a function named `checkfermat` that takes four parameters ($a$, $b$, $c$ and $n$) and checks to see if Fermat’s theorem holds. If $n$ is greater than 2 and $a^n + b^n == c^n$ the program should print, "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!" Otherwise the program should print, "No, that doesn’t work."

2. Write a function that prompts the user to input values for $a$, $b$, $c$ and $n$, converts them to integers, and uses checkfermat to check whether they violate Fermat’s theorem. Tip: check the functions `readline` and `parse`

3. Can you write the code so that the functions in 4.1 and 4.2 have the same name?

```julia;eval = false
```
